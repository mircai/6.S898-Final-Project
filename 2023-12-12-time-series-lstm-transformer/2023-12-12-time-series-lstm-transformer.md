# 6.S898 Final Project - LSTM vs Transformers for Time Series Modeling

By Miranda Cai and Roderick Huang

## 1. Introduction
In the context of time series forecasting, comparing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to Transformers is a fascinating exploration into the evolution of deep learning architectures. Despite having distinct strengths and approaches, both LSTM and transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and sequential data tasks. 

LSTMs, with their recurrent structure, were pioneers in capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the accuracy of such models have been shown to be quite effective in many applications, training LSTM models takes a relatively long time because of the fact that they must remember all past observances. One faster alternative to LSTM models are transformers. Transformers are able to remember only the important bits of inputs using an attention-mechanism, and is also parallelizable making it much faster to train than recursive LSTMs that must be processed sequentially. 

With its recent development, people have started opting to use transformer based models to solve sequence problems that once relied on LSTMs. One significant example is for NLP use cases, where transformers can process sentences as a whole rather than by individual words like LSTMs do. However, since transformers have been around for less than a decade, there are still many potential applications that are yet to be deeply explored. Thus, we will explore the effectiveness of transformers specifically for time series forecasting. Time series forecasting finds applications across a wide spectrum of industries including finance, supply chain management, energy, etc. 

Our goal is to realize which particular features of time series datasets could lead transformer-based models to outperform LSTM ones.
